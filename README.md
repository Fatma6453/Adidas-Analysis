### Recommendations
Focus on High-Performing Retailers:

West Gear and Foot Locker are strong contributors to sales. Consider developing exclusive products or promotions to further leverage these partnerships.
Walmart and Amazon could benefit from targeted marketing campaigns or better product placement to boost their sales figures.
Address Price Decline:

The 11% decrease in the average price per unit suggests possible price competition or discounting. Evaluate pricing strategies to ensure profitability isn't compromised while maintaining competitive pricing.
Regional Sales Optimization:

The West region's strong performance suggests potential for further growth. Consider increasing marketing efforts or expanding product offerings in this region.
For the Northeast and Midwest regions, analyze the market conditions to identify barriers to higher sales and develop targeted strategies to boost performance.
Enhance Online and In-Store Experience:

With Online and In-store sales being almost equal in their contribution, itâ€™s important to enhance the customer experience in both channels. Invest in improving the online shopping experience, including faster delivery and better user interface, and also focus on the in-store experience through better customer service and store ambiance.
Monitor Outlet Sales:

Outlet sales are consistent but lag behind other methods. Consider evaluating outlet strategies to identify opportunities for increasing sales, such as special promotions or exclusive product lines.
Seasonal Promotions:

The peak sales period during mid-year indicates an opportunity for strategic promotions during these months to maximize revenue. Ensure inventory levels are adequate to meet increased demand during these periods.
